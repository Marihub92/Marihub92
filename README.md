# Hi, I'm Shamarion 👋

👀 I’m interested in using data to solve real-world problems and improve decision-making, especially in business and healthcare settings. I’m passionate about learning how to turn raw data into meaningful insights.

🌱 I’m currently learning Excel for data analysis, Power BI, and SQL. I recently completed the “Intro to Data Analysis with Microsoft Excel” course and built my first sales data analysis project.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on beginner-friendly data projects, data storytelling challenges, and anything that helps me sharpen my skills in analytics and visualization.

😄 Pronouns: She/Her 

⚡ Fun fact: I’m transitioning from healthcare and tech support into data analytics — and discovering that this field perfectly matches my strengths in critical thinking, curiosity, and problem-solving.
